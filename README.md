# DoomSlayer
You are a super soldier named the Doomslayer tasked with protecting the Earth from the invasion of demons. The player receives points once a demon is succesfully shot. Scores are stored in the browser local storage with multi-kills granting additional score points. Each level is passed upon successful hit of 90% of the level's enemies.
